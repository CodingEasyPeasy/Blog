## Introduction

Javascript Variables are used for Storing Data. The assignment operator (=) is used to assign the values of the variables.

The fundamentals of declaring a variable in JavaScript :
- A reserved keyword cannot appear in a variable name.
- They are case sensitive.
- When declaring the variable it may have a dollar sign ($), underscore, letters, or digits.
- It can only start with an underscore ("_"), letter, or the symbol "$"

Ways to declare a Javascript variable:
- Using var
- Using let
- Using const
- Variables can also be declared automatically

### Tips: 

⭐ Always declare your variables before use. (Declaring with var, let or const). <br /><br />  
⭐ Note that (=) is the assignment operator while (==) is the "equal to" operator. <br /><br />  
⭐ JavaScript has recently undergone modifications (ECMAScript2015), adding const and let as additional keywords to declaring variables due to problems with the var keyword. [Learn More](https://www.codingeasypeasy.com/) <br /><br />  
⭐ Only use the var keyword when writing code for previous browser versions.

## Using Var

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
var myname = "John Walker";

console.log(myname);

//output
John Walker
```

## Using Let

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
let mynumber = 23;

console.log(mynumber);

//output
23
```

## Using Const

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
// These are unchangeable constant values.

const mynumber = 51;

console.log(mynumber);

//output
51
```

## Using variables in expressions

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
let x = 1;
let y = 2;

let z = x + y;

console.log(z);

//output
3
```

## Declaring variables and assigning values later

If the programmer doesn't assign a value to a declared variable before the statement is executed, the variable's value will remain undefined.

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
let x;
let y;

x = "Hello World!";

console.log(x);
//output
Hello World!

console.log(y);
//output
undefined
```

## Declaring many variables with one statement

Separate the variables by commas:

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
let student = "John White", age = 20, gender = "male";

console.log(student, age, gender);

//output
John White 20 male
```

## Conclusion

JavaScript variables have scope.
The accessibility (visibility) of variables within a program is determined by its scope.
Three types of scope exist for JavaScript variables:
- Block scope
- Function scope
- Global scope
