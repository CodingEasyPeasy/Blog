## Introduction

In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to integrate a react carousel component to a react application.

## What is a carousel?

A carousel is a dynamic component that displays a series of images or other content in a rotating, sliding, or scrolling manner. It's often used to showcase product images, featured articles, or testimonials on websites.

## Key features of a carousel:

- Multiple Slides: It contains multiple slides or panels, each displaying a different piece of content.
- Navigation Controls: Users can navigate through the slides using buttons, arrows, or dots.
- Auto-Advance: The carousel can automatically advance to the next slide after a specified interval.
- Responsive Design: It should adjust its appearance and behavior based on the screen size to ensure a good user experience on different devices.

## An example of a carousel

## Integrating a react carousel component to a react js application

There are several react carousel component packages that can be installed through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to add the carousel component.
Today we are going to use [react-multi-carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-multi-carousel).

## Getting started
- Create a new react project with vite [Learn more about creating react projects with vite](https://vite.dev/)

### Install react-multi-carousel package

```ts:Open the terminal and run
npm i react-multi-carousel
```

### Minimum working setup

In your `App.jsx` file import the react-multi-carousel package and add the code for the minimum working setup.

```ts:App.jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import Carousel from 'react-multi-carousel';
import 'react-multi-carousel/lib/styles.css';
import "./App.css";

//Add this code for a responsive carousel 
const responsive = {
  superLargeDesktop: {
    breakpoint: { max: 4000, min: 3000 },
    items: 5
  },
  desktop: {
    breakpoint: { max: 3000, min: 1024 },
    items: 3
  },
  tablet: {
    breakpoint: { max: 1024, min: 464 },
    items: 2
  },
  mobile: {
    breakpoint: { max: 464, min: 0 },
    items: 1
  }
};

function App() {

  return (
    <>
      <Carousel responsive={responsive}>
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: "red", width: 300, height: 300 }}>
          Item 1
        </div>
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: "purple", width: 300, height: 300 }}>
          Item 2
        </div>
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: "orange", width: 300, height: 300 }}>
          Item 3
        </div>
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: "aqua", width: 300, height: 300 }}>
          Item 4
        </div>
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: "violet", width: 300, height: 300 }}>
          Item 5
        </div>
      </Carousel>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

In your `index.css` add some styling to give padding to the carousel

```ts:index.css
body {
  padding: 100px;
}
```

// Output
